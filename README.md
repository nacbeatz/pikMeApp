This app is for users who feel lonely that want face to face interaction bit don’t want to approach people in real life

App Flow:
user register / logs in
map integration (Mapbox)
choose if the user want to be be picked up or to be the guy who actually picks someone else
if the user clicks pick he will see the map and if it s not registered and he want to pick someone he will need to register first
if he will click Pick Me he will need to register without clicking the map and after he registers or logs in he will see the map
Create / View peek request
The user who creates the peek request will appear on the map
The other user will see all the users who want to picked up on the map and there the user can press a botton and a pop up will appear with the user’s data who wants to be picked up (photo, name, activity (Enum))
the picker will get a pop with a button that will say . I will pick you up .
and then a match will happen and the pick will happen (like Uber)
